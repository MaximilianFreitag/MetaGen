This folder contains our pretrained neural networks. The file name of each model is in the format of `$DATA_$NETWORK_$TRAINING_$PORTION`.

`$DATA` has two values, `iset` and `set`, indicates that the model is trained on `iset.mm` or `set.mm`.

`$NETWORK` has three values, `pred`, `gen` and `payout`, indicates that this model is a relevance, substitution or payoff network.

`$TRAINING` has four values, `bsl`, `syn`, `rl`, `lm`. `bsl` refers to the model trained on human-written proofs only. `syn` refers to the model trained on both human data and synthetic data generated by MetaGen-IL. `rl` refers to the model trained on human data and synthetic data generated by MetaGen-RL. `lm` refers to the model of the theorem generator.

`$PORTION` has four values, `0`, `01`, `02`, `1`, indicates that the model is trained on 0%, 10%, 20% or 100% of human-written proofs. The model of iset.mm has no `$PORTION` keyword.

`set_rl_lm_0` contains the relevance and substitution networks of the MetaGen_RL generator trained on set.mm.
